            <h2>OBJECTIVE
            </h2>
            <p>The objective of the "FOGGE" mobile app development project is to enhance road safety by leveraging sensors to detect the presence and density of snow fog around a user's vehicle. These sensors, strategically placed either inside or outside the vehicle, will provide real-time data to the app. Additionally, the app will incorporate a feature to identify and count nearby vehicles, alerting the user to the presence of fast-moving vehicles in their vicinity. The primary goal is to prevent snow fog accidents, road mishaps, and vehicle damages by enabling users to make informed decisions based on the data provided by the integrated sensor system. Through this innovative solution, "FOGGE" aims to contribute significantly to reducing accidents caused by adverse weather conditions and promoting overall road safety.

                1.User is required to install our app in Andoid or iOS.<br>
                2.Then create an account to login.<br>
                3.And Login to our app.<br>
                4.Then user should pair the device by using Bluetooth.<br>
                5.After pairing the device, User should enter the unique code present in each device to get the access of that device.

                1.LiDAR Sensor detects the vehicles and obstacles even in massive fog.<br>
                2.Using HC-05 Blutooth modules receiving and transmitting were carried out effectively.
